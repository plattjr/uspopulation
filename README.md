# US Population Estimates, 2019
<BR>
Proportional Symbol map using graduated circles to show US population estimates by state using data from the US Census Bureau.  You are able to see the total population of each state, via popup, by clicking on the state's corresponding graduated circle.  The basemap is clean, simple, and of a monotone color scheme so the symbology is first in the visual hierarchy.

Using proportional symbology is a quick way to add depth to point data, in this case population in each state.  While it may not be an accurate representation of population density on a large scale map, it does provide good symbology for a broad look of population phenomena on a small scale map.  You can quickly tell which states are most populated and see the decrease in population in the Mountain West region.

To add to this map in the future, it would be beneficial to add additional symbology to the basemap as you zoom in (i.e: contour lines, county boundaries) and start separating the proportional symbols into those county boundaries, then into neighborhoods, etc.
