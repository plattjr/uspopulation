# US Population Estimates, 2019
<BR>
Proportional Symbol map using graduated circles to show US population estimates by state using data from the US Census Bureau.  You are able to see the total population of each state, via popup, by clicking on the state's corresponding graduated circle.

Using proportional symbology is a quick way to add depth to point data, in this case population.  While it may not be an accurate representation of population density on a large scale map, it does provide good symbology for a broad look of phenomena on a small scale map.
